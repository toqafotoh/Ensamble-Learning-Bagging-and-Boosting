# Movie Recommendation Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on various techniques for ensamble learning such as Bagging and Boosting, play a crucial role in improving model performance and robustness,cleaning data for ensuring high-quality input for machine learning models.

## Techniques Covered
1. Bagging: Bootstrap Aggregating for reducing variance and preventing overfitting.
2. Boosting: Sequentially training weak models to create a strong predictor.
3. Voting: Aggregating predictions from diverse models to make decisions.
4. Decision Trees: Understand the basics of Decision Trees and their role in classification and regression tasks.
5. Random Forest: Explore the concept of Random Forest, an ensemble of Decision Trees, for improved accuracy and generalization.
6. Gradient Boosting: Dive into Gradient Boosting, a boosting technique that sequentially trains weak learners to create a strong model.

## Dataset
In this project, we dive into a collection of 6,820 movies, packed with a variety of details. You can access and download this dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).
