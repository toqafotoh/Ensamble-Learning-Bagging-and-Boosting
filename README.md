# Ensamble Learning

## Introduction
This project focuses on various techniques for ensamble learning such as Bagging and Boosting, play a crucial role in improving model performance and robustness,cleaning data for ensuring high-quality input for machine learning models.

## Techniques Covered
1. Bagging: Bootstrap Aggregating for reducing variance and preventing overfitting.
2. Boosting: Sequentially training weak models to create a strong predictor.
3. Voting: Aggregating predictions from diverse models to make decisions.
4. Decision Trees: Understand the basics of Decision Trees and their role in classification and regression tasks.
5. Random Forest: Explore the concept of Random Forest, an ensemble of Decision Trees, for improved accuracy and generalization.
6. Gradient Boosting: Dive into Gradient Boosting, a boosting technique that sequentially trains weak learners to create a strong model.

## Dataset
For the examples and demonstrations, we'll use the [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies), which provides insights into movie-related data.
